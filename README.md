# mouseconn
A node util for linux for connecting to my logitech MX anywhere 2 that always seems to lose its connect on ubuntu

# Reason

I am in love with my Logitech MX anywhere 2S. Due to the nature of being able to save multiple devices, the address of the mouse keeps change, causing me to have to resync the mouse everyday.
Due to constantly resync, I also end up with many duplicate paired devices.  This script takes the ssid of the bluetooth device and establishes a connection.  It also purges all previously paired devices that share the ssid.
